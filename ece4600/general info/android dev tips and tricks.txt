things ive learned:

turn off dropbox sync until needed.  you'll get spammed with hundreds of file updates everytime someone compiles

debugging on your phone is easy. you may have to install specific drivers.  enabling development mode on phone is dependant on android version.

you can simulate android devices from ide, but it can be a bit of a resource hog.
